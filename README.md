# 🧭 EFDL: Ethical Framework Description Language

**EFDL** is a formal language for describing, comparing, and adapting ethical frameworks.  
It was designed as a bridge between philosophical ethics, AI alignment, and real-world decision-making under moral uncertainty.

## 🧠 Why EFDL?

Ethics today is fragmented. We have utilitarianism, deontology, libertarianism, care ethics—but no way to structurally compare them, especially when agents are resource-limited, cognitively bounded, or embedded in uncertain contexts.

**EFDL** offers:

- 💡 A structured language (YAML-based) to specify ethical frameworks;
- 🔬 A parametric format to define agents, values, goals, contexts, and outputs;
- 🛠 A toolkit for analyzing trade-offs, stability, and applicability across frameworks.

## 📘 What is EFDL+?

**EFDL+** extends the base language with:

- Topological and metric tools (`ethical distance`, `friction`, `stability`, `analytic continuation`);
- Navigation over the **Ethical Configuration Space** (ECS);
- Tools for resolving moral dilemmas, reframing metaethical problems, and adapting frameworks to agents;
- Descriptive ethics integration and cross-framework diagnostics.
