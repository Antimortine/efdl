    objective:
      primary:
        type: maximization
        metric: total happiness minus suffering

    agent:
      profile: ideal_rational_observer
      resources:
        computation: high
        cognition: advanced
        empathy: basic
      motivation: maximize total good

    context:
      knowledge: full
      timeframe: long_term
      scope: individual
      resources: unlimited

    expected_properties:
      normativity: mandatory
      output_format: choice_rule
      transparency: full

  output:
    rule_format: "Choose the action that yields the highest balance of pleasure over pain."
    normativity: mandatory
    resource_cost: high

    evaluation:
      goal_achievement: theoretical maximum
      tradeoffs:
        - "sacrifice of minority interests"
        - "requires complete information"
