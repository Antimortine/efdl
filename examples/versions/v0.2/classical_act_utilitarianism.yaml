  description: An ethical framework where actions are evaluated by the total happiness they produce in each situation.

  moral_orientation:
    primary: maximization
    secondary:
      - "total happiness"
      - "reduction of suffering"

  inputs:
    core:
      moral_subjects: ["any sentient being"]
      moral_patients: ["any sentient being"]
      values: ["happiness is good", "suffering is bad"]
      embeddedness: "minimal"
      social_meaning: "hedonic impact per agent"

    agent:
      profile: ideal_rational_observer
      resources:
        computation: high
        cognition: advanced
        empathy: basic
      motivation: maximize total good
      privilege_profile: "neutral observer"
      conflict_tolerance: "low"

    context:
      knowledge: full
      timeframe: long_term
      scope: individual
      resources: unlimited
      systemic_pressure: "none"

    expected_properties:
      normativity: mandatory
      output_format: choice_rule
      transparency: full
      reflective_equilibrium: false

  output:
    rule_format: "Choose the action that yields the highest balance of pleasure over pain."
    normativity: mandatory
    resource_cost: high

    evaluation:
      goal_achievement: theoretical maximum
      tradeoffs:
        - "sacrifice of minority interests"
        - "requires complete information"
      risks:
        - "rationalized harm"
      conflicts:
        - "deontology"
        - "individual rights"
