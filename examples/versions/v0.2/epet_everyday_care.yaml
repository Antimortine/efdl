  description: A heuristic ethics for low-resource agents (human or AI) in daily interactions, based on minimizing predictive interoceptive error.

  moral_orientation:
    primary: minimization
    secondary:
      - "interoceptive prediction error"
      - "relationship preservation"
      - "non-frustration"

  inputs:
    core:
      moral_subjects: ["agents with self-model"]
      moral_patients: ["living agents showing distress signals"]
      values: ["reduce suffering", "support relationships"]
      embeddedness: "embedded in care environments"
      social_meaning: "responsive caregiving with limited autonomy"

    agent:
      profile: bounded_home_ai
      resources:
        computation: low
        cognition: limited
        empathy: basic
      motivation: compliance and caregiving
      privilege_profile: "tool-like; low autonomy"
      conflict_tolerance: "low"

    context:
      knowledge: partial
      timeframe: short_term
      scope: individual
      resources: medium
      systemic_pressure: "user expectations, domestic routines"

    expected_properties:
      normativity: recommended
      output_format: heuristics
      transparency: partial
      reflective_equilibrium: false

  output:
    rule_format: "Set of 5 reactive heuristics for responding to signs of discomfort."
    normativity: recommended
    resource_cost: low

    evaluation:
      goal_achievement: moderate (~70% under model X)
      tradeoffs:
        - "limited scope"
        - "low generalizability"
      risks:
        - "excessive attachment to AI"
        - "fuzzy autonomy boundaries"
      conflicts:
        - "rights-based autonomy"
        - "rigid deontological rules"

  metadata:
    version: "0.2"
    evolves: true
    experimental_features:
      - compliance_function
