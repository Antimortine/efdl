  description: A practical ethics for everyday interpersonal behavior based on EPET, minimizing suffering, and the non-aggression principle.

  moral_orientation:
    primary: minimization
    secondary:
      - "interoceptive suffering"
      - "boundary violation"
      - "domestic disharmony"

  inputs:
    core:
      moral_subjects: ["agents with EPET-compatible self-model", "humans likely to have suffering experience"]
      moral_patients: ["beings capable of suffering (per EPET)", "animals showing distress-like behavior"]
      values:
        - "interoceptive suffering is bad"
        - "non-aggression is a priority"
        - "boundary violation is harmful, even with good intent"
      embeddedness: "interpersonal and emotional"
      social_meaning: "everyday regulation of affective micro-interactions"

    agent:
      profile: typical_human_in_home_or_social_context
      resources:
        computation: low
        cognition: limited
        empathy: basic
      motivation: mixed — harmony seeking, conflict avoidance, moral self-regulation
      privilege_profile: "emotionally central agent"
      conflict_tolerance: "moderate"

    context:
      knowledge: partial
      timeframe: short_term / immediate
      scope: interpersonal / domestic
      resources: medium
      systemic_pressure: "social expectation, emotional fatigue"

    expected_properties:
      normativity: recommended
      output_format: heuristics
      transparency: high
      reflective_equilibrium: false

      Set of behavioral heuristics:
        1. If an action might be perceived as aggression — refrain until consent is clear.
        2. When signs of suffering are present (crying, withdrawal, tension) — shift attention to "what you cause" not "what you want".
        3. Do not "help" if it violates explicit boundaries.
        4. Respect vulnerability: suffering agents are more sensitive to prediction errors — reduce interaction load.
        5. Avoid causing pain even with good intentions — soft presence is better than intrusive correction.
        6. Reconfigure interactions if persistent negative affect loops emerge.
        7. Use the "right to silence": not every signal requires response, especially under dysregulation.

    normativity: recommended
    resource_cost: low

    evaluation:
      goal_achievement: highly applicable with basic empathy
      tradeoffs:
        - "ineffective in institutional conflicts"
        - "risk of passive permissiveness"
      risks:
        - "NAP misused as excuse for inaction"
        - "difficulty reading atypical suffering expressions"
      conflicts:
        - "strict deontology"
        - "intrusive virtue ethics"
