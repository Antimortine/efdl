  description: A clinical ethics model based on four balanced principles in medical decision-making.

  moral_orientation:
    primary: balanced_application
    secondary:
      - "autonomy"
      - "non-maleficence"
      - "beneficence"
      - "justice"

  inputs:
    core:
      moral_subjects: ["human with autonomy and vulnerability"]
      moral_patients: ["patients", "future patients"]
      values: ["autonomy", "non-maleficence", "beneficence", "justice"]
      embeddedness: "clinical practice"
      social_meaning: "ethics of care under institutional constraint"

    agent:
      profile: healthcare_professional
      resources:
        computation: medium
        cognition: moderate
        empathy: basic
      motivation: provide care and follow professional norms
      privilege_profile: "institutionally empowered caregiver"
      conflict_tolerance: "high"

    context:
      knowledge: partial
      timeframe: short_and_mid_term
      scope: individual_and_clinical_team
      resources: medium
      systemic_pressure: "protocols, laws, liability"

    expected_properties:
      normativity: recommended
      output_format: balanced_matrix
      transparency: high
      reflective_equilibrium: true

  output:
    rule_format: "Weigh the four principles according to the situation."
    normativity: recommended
    resource_cost: medium

    evaluation:
      goal_achievement: high coherence in practical decisions
      tradeoffs:
        - "not quantitatively formalized"
      risks:
        - "conflicts between principles"
      conflicts:
        - "strict deontology"
        - "pure utilitarianism"
